i parse the monster_desc.txt file and store the resulting data into a monster_template class, which uses a dice class to store
any values that need to be rolled for. after parsing the monster i add the monster_template to a single linked list which is
stored in my character_creator class. The character_creator has an unfinished method that will allow me to generate an npc object
from any of the templates.
