for this assignment i used a linked list to connect the different floors in the dungeon,
 a heap for each floors turn order, and an array for each floors character list. each
 floor stores pointers to its own data, so when moving to each floor the status of the
 everything on the floor is preserved. When the player dies the game is stuck in Look
 Mode until the user closes the program. the starting floor has no up staircase only
 a descending one. Each floor below has one more monster than the floor above, making
 the game more difficult as you progress. when the play goes down a floor they start
 on top of the upwards stair case.

 AMENDMENT
  During lecture i was told that i was required to have stairs going both up
  and down on the first floor, so i altered my program, it now randomly places
  both stairs on the players first visit to any floor. However when the PC
  returns to a floor then will apear on the stairs they took previously. So i have
  semi connected floors.
