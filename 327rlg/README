i added a new file for doing the file reading and writing, the functions
write all the map data to a file as instructed. I only did big endian conversion
on the file size value and the version number value because it seemed to me
that everything else was 1 byte so it wouldnt need the conversion. I think
the most important work i did during this assignment was reorganizing my code
and changing the type of the hardness array to uint8_t. It should be easier to
add code on top of the exising project going forward with this new organization.
