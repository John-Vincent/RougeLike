In this assignment I added another 3 array's of the board to the dungeon struct,
one holds pointers to the characters. this makes it easy for me to print the characters
as well as detect attacks. the other array is a distance array except it holds
the distances for monsters that want to move in a straight line, and one for non tunneling
monsters. i used a character struct to represent both the monsters and the player character.
i didnt all the logic for moving the PC and the NPC's in one function called take turn.
