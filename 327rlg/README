currently this project is broken. It worked with previous versions of gcc but now for
some reason the constructor for character_creator breaks at the end of the function call.
the output from stepping through the end of the function in gdb is the following,

Breakpoint 1, character_creator::character_creator (this=0x555555780280)
    at src/mon_file_parser.cpp:176
176	  in.close();

(gdb) next
178	}
(gdb) next

any help solving this problem would be much appreciated.
