I made the game save the current state include equipment, bag items, and floor states.
it saves the game state to the same location as the previous save assignment, "~/.rlg327/dungeon".
it uses the same commands as the last save/load assignment with --save and --load being the
command line arguments to tell the program if you want to save your game when you exit and if you want to
load the currently saved game when you close. since you have to commit to saving/loading when you launch
it prevents "save scumming" on the part of the player.
