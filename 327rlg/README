I made all of the inputs from the assignment document except for the Inspect command.
all of my other inventory management inputs display the description so i didnt feel i
needed to made a seperate command just for the description. From the Wear screen
the user can equip multiple items, from the take off screen the user can unequip
multiple items, and from the delete screen the user can delete multiple items.
The drop screen is limited to only one item then it returns to normal COMMAND mode
since i only allow one item on the floor in any given location. you can switch from
any screen to any other screen at any time. The damage, defense, and view range for the
torches are all functional.

To test the combat i recommend you use time seed "-t 1491860909", in this dungeon
you can get the aegis right next to the spawn then move through the corridor in the upper right,
grab the torch and then in the middle of the first room you come to there is "The One Ring". After
you get this you can move through the corridor on your left and you should run into a "Duran's Bane",
just press space and let it try to hit you, it wont be able to do damage. Then you can remove some of the armor
and it will be able to kill you.
