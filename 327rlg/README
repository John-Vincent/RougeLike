I print out the same dungeon as before but now with the monsters and items from the
file's. when you walk over an item it displays the items name. When you kill or are killed
by a monster it prints a message with that monsters name. I only display the first color that is
listed in the files for the monsters. Also i dont use the color black i changed it to blue.
