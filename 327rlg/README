i used a heap to run dijkstras algorithm, and an array backed graph to store the
values of the map during the algorithm. I print the 3 diffrent views in the order
Normal view, non-tunnling view, then tunneling view. then exit. my save and load
functions still work because i do everything with the character and path finding
after any saving or loading.
