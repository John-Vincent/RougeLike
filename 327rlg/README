For this assignent i added the character.cpp npc.cpp and pc.cpp classes to the project and
programed my project to interface with the new c++ classes.
i also added another 2d array that keeps track of what locations the PC has visited.
i also added a check to make sure that the NPC's are within 5 tiles away from the PC before they are rendered.
