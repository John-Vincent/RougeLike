for this assignment i used a linked list to connect the different floors in the dungeon,
 a heap for each floors turn order, and an array for each floors character list. each
 floor stores pointers to its own data, so when moving to each floor the status of the
 everything on the floor is preserved. When the player dies the game is stuck in Look
 Mode until the user closes the program. the starting floor has no up staircase only
 a descending one. Each floor below has one more monster than the floor above, making
 the game more difficult as you progress. when the play goes down a floor they start
 on top of the upwards stair case.
