------------------------------------ASSIGNMENT 1.01------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
January 24, 10:00pm - 1:30am :
  made Makefile main.c room.c and dungeonRoom.h files
    main.c
      - added generatehardness function - complete
      - added initRandom function - complete
      - added main function up to gnereateRooms function call

    dungeonRoom.h
      - added Room struct and defined type as Room_t
      - added generateRooms function prototype

    room.h
      - started generateRooms function

January 25, 1:00pm - 2:30pm :
  finish typing generateRooms - have yet to test
    room.h
      - finished generateRooms function in thoery

January 25, 3:00pm-11:00pm :
  - made function to print to screen - printGrid(char[][])
  - made second array to hold a character representation of the game board for easy printing - first array only held hardness
      and i just descovered that paths and rooms have the same hardness so it was going to be difficult to print.
  - found a whole lot of bugs in my generateRooms function
      - bug that prevented me from entering second loop
      - bug that resulted in rooms being placed too close to each other(error in my equation)
      - bug that allowed first room to be placed out of bounds(checked bounds with room collision and the first room never
          enters that loop)
  -added connect_rooms function
    -found bug in connect_rooms: the paths are print with gaps in them when the slope is very high
    -found bug that from my fix to the last bug, it wouldn't print in a horazontal line because it wouldn't enter the new loop i made
      adding a assignment to the first case outside the loop fixed the problem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------ASSIGNMENT 1.02-----------------------------------------------------------------------
January 31, 10:00pm-10:30pm :
  -made load.c, gameio.h, and save.c files as well as .rlg327 directory
  -updated Makefile to compile these new classes.

February 1, 16:32-23:47 :
  -reorganized things to clean up main file.
  -made the generateRooms function which has most of the logic the the main
    function had in 1.01, this allows me to control when to generateRooms
    or when to do other operations in the new main method going forward.
    -found bug i need to use a pointer to the room_t pointer so that i can
      actually keep the array in the main function after generate Rooms runs
  -made enum to tell what mode the program is in
  -added function readArgs to interpret the command line arguments
  -bug found with enum, the name mode_t was already taken by stdlib
  -changed enum name to game_mode_t
  -finished readArgs - no bugs
  -added saveMap function which will create the save file
  -changed my hardness array to an uint8_t instead of an int
      to make reading and writing easier
  -finished saveMap - no bugs :)
  -changed main to use saveMap
  -finished loadMap - i had a bug with the math for reading the rooms.
  -changed the main function to make the necessary function calls for each mode
  -added save load and load_save functions to main.c to clean up the look of main.c
  -added new line to file string on accident so i removed that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------ASSIGNMENT 1.03-----------------------------------------------------------------------
February 3, 16:20-20:00 :
  -added dungeon struct to help keep track of the data in main.
  -pulled includes into the header files for organization.
  -added path_finder.c which is going to hold the code to implement dijkstras algorithm
  -added heap file to to make my own heap implementation.
  -finished heap but needed to do level order traversal so i made que file to
      add my own que implementation
  -finished que, had lots of bugs where i wasnt initalizing things properly so
    it would have a bunch of garbage in the pointer memory locations. This resulted
    in me hunting down segmentaiton falts for an hour or so, but now i can get back
    to testing my heap.

February 8, 9:00-12:09 :
  -finished writing heap and testing, lots of bugs found too many to list
  -finished writing path_finder which uses the heap to find the shortest path and then returns a path_t linked list with all the
      data for which map location is in the path.
  -finished tying my path_finder into the map file.
  -changed makefile to create a bin/ directory and store all generated files in there

February 13, 1:30-23:00 :
  - hid vertex_t within the pathfinder file
  - add the find_distances fuction to the pathfinder file to complete the actual assignment for 1.03
  - add the character file to do operations for the player character
  - added the make character function that will generate a character in a room and set its symbol
  - bug in heap where i was using 8 bit int to keep track of a 32 sized numebr
  - bug in path finder where i didnt change from left to right when i copy pasted
  - reorganized when everything prints so that i have more control in the main file
  - found bug in save function where i wasn't passing by pointer so the main values for the dungeon room and room
      number never got set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------Assigment 1.04--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Februrary 16, 10:30-11:30  :
    -fixed but with the hardness values around the boarder
      -now the tunnling path map should display 9's for all values with a hardness of 255
          and every value around the edge should have a hardness of 255, (the actaul distance is 0x7FF7, which should be
          high enough to prevent any npc from using it).

  Februrary 20, 20:45-24:23 :
    -added des.c and des.h files which will hold the functions for storing the turn order and
      and calling the takeTurn Functions.
    -added the takeTurn function to the character.h file.
    -added speed attribute to the character struct.
    -added the next turn value to the character struct.
    -added the monster struct.
    -added character_t to dungeon_t
    -added generate_monsters to character.h
    -added attribute definitions to character.h
    -removed make_character from character.c, it just doesnt fit my design anymore
    -added display function in main.c because i dont want to rewrite the printMap function in map.c

  Februrary 22, 16:20 - 24:00 :
    -moved display to des.c
    -added can_see which uses Bresenam's algorithm to test line of sight
    -code the take_turn method
    -made the run_game method
    -added a peek method to my heap so i can look without having to pop
    -found bug, i forgot to set the old locations to null on the character map
    -found bug i set the distance to 0xFFFFFFFF which made it negative one so all the
      characters that were supose to know where the player was never acually found a distance
      smaller in the distance array, so they would get assigned a random move.
    -found bug when i let monsters move diagonally they would dig through digaonal paths
        and this would crash my path finding algorith because i only connected things 4 ways
        so i would have a bunch of nodes in the heap that would become isolated at the end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------Assignemtn 1.05-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Februrary 23, 14:00 - 15:30  :
    -played around with add ncurses to des.c
    -added getch call and stored result in the players attribute field since it was
        unused space.
    -added a message char * to the dungeon_t that way anything can add a message to
        be displayed during the output.
    -added the player_turn function to character to better organize the logic for player turns
    -added a uint_8 x and y to dungeon for the view x and y location
    -added the generate stairs function to map.c
    -added switch statement in des.c that will handle the more basic input operations.
    -added pointer to heap in the dungeon_t that way each floor can preserve the turn
        order of the characters on the floor
    -added the functionality to generate new floors, and added two dungeon_t pointers the
        dungeon_t so i can connect floors in a linked list
    -changed the look mode so that it scrolls by 10 units instead of a whole screen size
        the entire screen moving was too disorientating.
    -added color coding so that its easy to identify the different objects
    -added dungeon.c and dungeon.h to seporate it from the main file
    -moved as many includes from the headers to the source files as possible
    -changed it so that when first visiting a floor the PC is randomly placed and
        both stairs are in different locations, but when returning the PC will start
        on the corrisponding staircase
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------Assignment 1.06--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  March 23, 3:00pm - 2:12am :
    -created the character_cpp.h header which will be the header file for character.cpp npc.cpp and pc.cpp
    -created the character npc and pc classes as well as the prototypes for the functions that will allow the
        C code to interface with the c++ code.
    -coded the functions for all the cpp and made the small changes necissary to use the cpp in the rest of my
        project. Since i had already been following a sudo object-oriented pattern with my C code, it was pretty
        easy to substitute in the c++.
    -removed the Characters 2d array and renamed the player pointer to characters, now i just have an array of all
        the characters.
    -added a new 2d array to the dungeon struct called visited which remembers the locations the player has been to.
    -added a check to see if NPC's are within 5 blocks of the PC before printing them to the screen
    -added a check to make sure the visited array value is 1 before printing a environment character to the screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------Assignment 1.07----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  March 27, 5:00pm - 10:00pm  :
    -changed all the file extensions to .cpp
    -started work on converting the dungeon struct to a dungeon class with an internal class named level


 March 28, 6:00pm - 10:00pm   :
   -worked on the dungeon class

 March 29, 1:00pm - 2:30pm    :
   -finished debugging the dungeon class, now it works as it did previously
   -used A_BOLD to highlight the area of the map the the play can see currently.

  March 29, 4:00pm - 2:00am    :
    -added the mon_file_parser head which contains every class needed for the parsing
    -added the dice class
    -added the monster_template class
    -added the character_creator class
    -added the template_holder class inside character_creator
    -coded all the functions
    -found bug where i had the wrong file name
    -found bug where i was trying to use strcat with getenv("HOME") as the first argument
    -found bug where if i started parsing a monster that was invalid since i used the same template object for the next monster
        some of the members of the template where lost, causing a memory leak (thanks valgrind)
    -found bug where i called set_dam instead of set_hp so i was never setting the hp of the template causing it to think the template was invalid
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------Assignment 1.08-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  April 4, 20:00 - 24:00 :
    -worked on item parsing

  April 5, 19:00 - 3:00  :
    - finished item parsing
    - found bug with vector and item * where i was getting double free's
    - added changes to dungeon to allow the messages to be displayed and the items to be stored in the level
    - also reverted back to a character matrix but this time with only a pointer to player and no other characters
    - changed memory deallocation to allow freeing characters after they are removed from the matrix
    - found bug with double delete of player when he was still in the map
    - added item generation from parsed templates
    - added npc generate from parsed templates
    - added item_creator and monster_creator to dungeon so they are auto allocated and deallocated with the dungeon
    - changed character generation to make items and use the creator's
    - changed how the character to print is calculated.
